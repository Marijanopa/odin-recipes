<p1>I used ground Italian Sausage, and it's probably the best if you have any on hand.  Otherwise, you can use ground beef or even ground pork sausage.  Sweet, mild, or hot sausage is fine.
    For the cheeses, I used shredded mozzarella, shredded parmesan, and dollops of mascarpone because that's what I had on hand.  I know not everyone keeps mascarpone around so feel free to sub it out with dollops of cream cheese, ricotta, or even cottage cheese!
    I do have a recipe for homemade Pizza Sauce that's great, it makes a decent sized batch and you can freeze if you want to make extra.  Otherwise, just use your fave marinara or pizza sauce from the store.
    I did use all dried herbs because that's what I always have in my pantry.  Dried oregano and basil sprinkled over the garlic butter crust and the entire pizza really make this heavenly.  You can always use fresh herbs if you have some!</p1>
